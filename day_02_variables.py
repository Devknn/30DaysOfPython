Inside 30DaysOfPython create a folder called day_2. Inside this folder create a file named variables.py
Write a python comment saying 'Day 2: 30 Days of python programming'
Declare a first name variable and assign a value to it
Declare a last name variable and assign a value to it
Declare a full name variable and assign a value to it
Declare a country variable and assign a value to it
Declare a city variable and assign a value to it
Declare an age variable and assign a value to it
Declare a year variable and assign a value to it
Declare a variable is_married and assign a value to it
Declare a variable is_true and assign a value to it
Declare a variable is_light_on and assign a value to it
Declare multiple variable on one line
Exercises: Level 2
Check the data type of all your variables using type() built-in function
Using the len() built-in function, find the length of your first name
Compare the length of your first name and your last name
Declare 5 as num_one and 4 as num_two
Add num_one and num_two and assign the value to a variable total
Subtract num_two from num_one and assign the value to a variable diff
Multiply num_two and num_one and assign the value to a variable product
Divide num_one by num_two and assign the value to a variable division
Use modulus division to find num_two divided by num_one and assign the value to a variable remainder
Calculate num_one to the power of num_two and assign the value to a variable exp
Find floor division of num_one by num_two and assign the value to a variable floor_division
The radius of a circle is 30 meters.
Calculate the area of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of area_of_circle
Calculate the circumference of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of circum_of_circle
Take radius as user input and calculate the area.
Use the built-in input function to get first name, last name, country and age from a user and store the value to their corresponding variable names
Run help('keywords') in Python shell or in your file to check for the Python reserved words or keywords
